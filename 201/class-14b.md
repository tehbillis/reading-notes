# What Google learned from its quest to build the perfect team

Psychological Safety:

* A shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.
* A sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject, or punish someone for speaking up.
* It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.

## Questions

1. **What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams? -** Clear and honest communication, Trust / respect, and healthy conflict management.
2. **Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety. -** I worked with a small group of people on a dev team writing software for a file storage company. the existing members of the group had high expectations of me, the new guy, and had no problem letting me know I was wrong, but rarely let me know when i was doing a good job. I felt as though i wasn't progressing and that i wasn't doing anything correctly. i never seemed to meet their expectations. I can't even say that they were overly critical of my ideas because i never had the opportunity to share them. I left the team and moved on.
3. **What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members? -** they are usually more effective and accomplished. They are more innovative, and members are usually more satisfied with their work and have a higher sense of well-being.

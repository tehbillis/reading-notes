# Forms and JS Events

## HTML Forms

### First Webform

Forms are a way for users to input data that can be sent to a server or used right away to update a web page.

The `form` element formally defines a form. It is standard practice to always set the `action` and `method` attributes. Action defines the location (URL) that the forms data is sent. And method defines the way it is sent. Either `get` or `post`.

`input` and `text area` define elements that allow you to input text. They let you do it either as a single line item or as a large input box. They are usually paired with `label` elements.

Button elements are what you use to submit the form to the predefined URL. It's attribute `type` will accept 3 values.

* submit - to submit the form.
* reset - to reset the form.
* button - to do nothing! It's very useful for creating custom buttons with JS.

When submiting a form, it's important to define the `name` attribute on all the inputs so that they can be properly ahjandled on the back-end.

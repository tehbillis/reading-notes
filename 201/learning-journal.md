# Learning Journal

A place to reflect on what I have learned today.

## Day 01

There are a few things that I would like to go over in my journal today. First, the questions presented to me for the first assignment. How do I see myhself planning & evaluating my learning? What details will I record and measure. And finally, I would like to touch on my why. My reason for doing all of this.

### Planning & Evaluating

It's important to me that I succeed in my goals to learn software development, So I have come up with a few things that I will do that I think will help. Let's look at what I can do when it comes to planning my learning:

1. **Set Clear Goals:** I will define what I wish to achieve with my learning. I will set out clear and measurable goals that will give me purpose and direction.
2. **Create a Learning Plan:** I will outline the steps and resources needed to reach my goals. This should include some timelines, milestones, and maybe a list of materials that I'll need. Codefellows completes most of this already, but I can add onto their course plan and I can create my own timelines since I'm doing the self paced course.
3. **Prioritize:** I will find out which topics or skills are most important and relevent to my goals and focus on mastering them before branching out to related areas. Such as mastering HTML, CSS and JS basics before moving on.
4. **Gather Resources:** I will identify the books, online courses, mentors, or anything else I will need to achieve my goals. Most of this has actually been completed, I Will just need to compile them into a document.
5. **Establish a Routine:** I have already decided that I will be setting time aside in the mornings and sometimes in the evenings for my learning. So far the move from evening learning to morning has been slow going, but I will commit to setting myself up for succeeding in this goal and sticking to it.
6. **Stay Organized:** I will keep all my notes organized in my reading notes repo, as well as continue to post my learning experiences in my blog. It may make sense for my blog to essentially become my learning journal for now.

Now let's take a look at what I can do to evaluate my learning:

1. **Codefellows:** Codefellows is already set up to show me what i'm learning and what I need to work a little more on. Tests and quizes will help me understand where I stand.
2. **Feedback:** I will seek feedback from my mentors and my peers.
3. **Regular Self-Assessment:** I will take time through the week to assess my understanding and skill level of the topic that I'm learning and determine if I'm meeting my milestones.
4. **Spaced Repetition:** I will use spaced repetition techniques to review past content and ensure that I am retaining the knowledge that I have learned and solidify it in my mind in the process. It will be a way to see what I need to review and what I have actually learned. Anki cards will probably be my main tool here.
5. **Celebrate:** I will make sure to do something I rarely do, but I will celebrate and acknowledge my achievements and milestones along the way as a way to keep myself motivated.

It's important for me to remember that learning is a journey, it is a continuous activity that I will be doing for the rest of my life. Looking for ways to improve, and taking joy in the process of learning will be very beneficial to me.

## Day 02

Today I will go ahead a write a breif reflection on what I learned this day. Overall the content was really good. I can't say that any of the information was really new, but I took the opportunity to solidify most of the knowledge that I already knew. Specifically the JS learnings. The logic is something I feel like I have a solid understanding of, and it was nice to knock the cobwebs out of my mind and see just how much I remember and understand.

When it came to the CSS though, I have certainly worked with the box model before and have struggled with it over the years. In fact, I would describe the way I initially learned it was by struggling with it. But it was very nice to get a more in depth understanding of just what is going on here and the ways that it can be used and manipulated.

Lists are somethings I'm familiar with, though I have never once changed the attributes on a list to have it display different symbols and numbers or reverse the list. That was really cool to learn!

## Day 03

Today We learned about hyperlinks, layouts, and functions. We also touched on the concept of paired programming. Turns out hyperlinks are a way to not only navigate to different pages on the web, but they're also handy in navigating the page itself. Layouts are pretty important when it comes to making a page look the way you wish. Understanding how normal flow works and how you can use positioning to modify that flow, and create unique styles. There are a number of positioning styles that you can use to achieve these uinique effects. Functions are a standard way to organize code that you want to do a singel thing, but access it more than once.

Pair programming is a concept that i'm familiar with but is something that i've never actually done. I understand the concepts of each role, I even did a little bit of a dive on how to be a good driver and how to be a good navigator. Seems teamwork, collaboration, constructive communication and keeping an open mind is key here. It can probably be tough to work with someone who you feel is constantly shooting down your ideas and calling them stupid. It seems important to let the driver make the decisions, and to only offer suggestions and then step back to let them choose what to do. when driving it seems important to be clear what your thought process is, what you're doing, and why. of course there is a lot more to it than just this, but these are what seem to be some of the most important things that stood out to me.

## Day 04

Today was all about colors, images, and text. Honestly these are some of the topics I fear the most simply because I feel i'm not that proficient with them. Going over images was not so bad, i've worked with them before and I learned a lot about the accessibility aspect that goes along with them. That is something new to me that I'm glad  I learned. Going over all the image types was great because there were quite a few that I was not familiar with but i'm glad I know about now!

Fonts and colors were the topics that my brain kind of lost focus on. These are things I find difficult to grasp, so my brain wants to do anything but these things. I'm glad I made it through the material because I feel like I came out of it with a better understanding and more confidence in myself. My about me project reflects that, The entire project used zero colors until these classes. It really is just a lot and i'm afraid that I will miss something, but I know it's not something I should let hold me back.

Working more with git branching was so great. Branching finally makes sense to me, and I'm confident enough to work with it no questions asked now.

## Class 06

Today was all about objects and interacting with the DOM. Going over objects was really great because it was such a big part of what i learned in high school and used in my early career. They are a great way to work with data. Most of what i learned about JS objects is small sematics, like every property or method is followed by a comma. Or how to properly use the `this` keyword in an object.

Working with the DOM has always been scary for me. It has always seemed like this big unknowable box of magic, but after working with it today it actually is starting to make sense. My typical way of interacting with the DOM is to build up a string of custom HTML and injecting that into different elements that already exist in the page. but today i did a hybrid of that and creating the elements on the fly. I really liked creating them programatically and i think i will try to find a way to do that with not just the generated `<ul>` list but with its corresponding header as well.

## Class 07

Today we leaned in on prototypes and html tables. This was an exciting topic for me because we went over the extreme basics of object constructors and just how prototypes work. It makes sense but i had no idea that keeping methods on the prototype actually keeps your application from using too many resources. I learned that the govorning body that controls the javascript language decided to impliment classes into the language. Coming from C# as my primary language, this makes me very happy because the concepts transfer very well. I was able to pick it up and run with it, no problem at all.

Tables are pretty fun to work with. I remember when i first started playing around with html, Tables were definitely a tool that i used to lay things out with, and i can see now why that's no longer a good idea. During my work i had to relearn how to navigate tables with javascript to get the information that i needed to total the cookie sales. It was very much like working with multi-dimensional arrays.

## Class 08

Today I learned about the flexbox. It's a newer set of css tools that solves a problem that I so frequently encountered in my days of creating web pages. Before if you wanted to get things to somewhat line up you would have to use floats and positioning. But all of that can be a real hassle. Flexbox really does come in and save the day when it comes to laying out content on a webpage. It's still not a silver bullet to all layout scenarios, as it will only work on a single axis of direction. Either up and down, or left and right. But whatever you wish to do along those planes you can pretty much line it up with flexbox. Working through the assignment I am able to see right away how useful this will be for not just entire page layouts, but for small components as well such as navigation or menus. 

After using the flexbox to actually lay out a couple of websites I can say with confidence that it was a million times easier to get things lined up and positioned where i wanted them to be than using floats and 5 million divs. Though it was easier to use, that doesn't mean i didn't encounter some obstacles. there were a few places where i became a little confused as to why elements weren't lining up as i expected, but with some playing around i did eventually get them to work. I will be doing these wireframe exercises at least once a week to sharpen my skills in this area.

## Class 09

Today we went over HTML forms and javascript events. These are some of the most important tools to learn as so much of the modern web relies on them. We learned about how forms are layed out and the children elements contained within them. We learned how to send data to a server or to a javascript function. We learned that it's important to define the name attributes on the inputs as well, your code won't work unless you do. We learned how to group elements together with a fieldset element. And we went over how important labels are not just to regular users, but also to users who use accessibility tools.

We dove into javascript events as well. we covered what they are, how to create them, the different ways they can be used and some of their peculiar functionality. We learned not only how to add them to elements, but also how to remove them. You can also add more than one if done a certain way! We learned that it's not good practice anymore to use inline event handlers in the HTML anymore. We went over how to prevent the default behaviour of events. Bubbling and capturing was also discussed, we went over what to be wary of as well as how they can be useful.

Overall a great section, the events portion of the class did not feel like a review for me. I felt like i learned so much! And it's always so fun to get your code working and doing cool things!

## Class 10

Today we read over javascript debugging and the tools used to do that. There was some good information about the supplied tools that are built into browsers and all the features that they offer. It's nice to know that there are more formal ways of huhting down issues that aren't just using `console.log();`. Don't get me wrong though, that console log can save your butt and be extremely usefull in some cases. Learning how to read the errors that the browser gave you was really nice, it helps narrow down where to look for the issue.

Our labs focused around styling. Oh man, i was able to get lab-b done fairly quickly and easily once I got clarification on the requirements. After that I moved on to lab-a. I thought i was going to rock it and get it done in no more than 3 hours. Wow was i wrong. It took me closer to 6 hours to complete. Lots of time was spent trying to figure out why things weren't doing what i expected them to do, I was missing the css reset so i was getting shafted with some of the defaults. I also spent a lot of time searching for the correct fonts. i didn't see anywhere that they were supplied. And I fell into my old ways of measuring the example picture for exact spacing. I think i got really close to the original, but there may be some small differences here and there.

Overall, a great learning experience! I'm going to have to do this again, many times, to sharpen up those skills!

## Class 11

Today was all about Audio, video, and the grid! we started off going over the various ways you can use video on your site. Then we moved on to how to embed audio on your site. apparently it's almost the same, just without a couple features. 

The grid was a fairly complicated topic to go over though. There is just sooo much to it. I think a single day is not enough time to go over and retain all of that information. but we went over how to create a grid, how to layout items within it, special sizing units, and how to position the items in the grid.

I attempted to bring what i learned about the grid with me into my lab. Oh man that lab looked scary when i first read through it. I thought for sure it was going to take me all week to complete what it was asking for. I guess having each individual talk laid out like that made it seem like there was much much more than it really was. I worked with a classmate at the begining and helped him get going on his project while i worked on mine. I'm not sure if he completed his today, I hope he did. If not i'll help him tomorrow.

## Class 12

This class was about drawing objects to the screen. Building the foundation of the course on the `<canvas>` element, we learned the basic properties of it and how it works. we went over how this element is meant to be manipulated with javascript to display shapes and objects. and finally we went over how to manipulate the canvas with javascript.

We spent a lot of time going over chart.js starting from how to add it to your project, then how to create a new chart and connect it to your canvas, how to pick the style of chart you want and how to style it. We also went over how to add your data to it, it's very simple to do in javascript. 

The lab was mostly easy for me, I made a few logic mistakes here and there that were not noticed until i added the new functionality from this labs user stories. issues like referencing a method instead of calling it causing issues with my data, and then assigning an array to another then immediately clearing the referenced array. thus clearing my new array that was supposed to act as a sort of backup of the original. That issue was solved by slicing the original array to the new one. Adding the chart wasn't much of a hassle, it took some time but it was the first time i have ever used it so that was to be expected. Styling it and having it placed where i wanted on the page took more time than i had wanted. but i guess i'm still learning how to do that as well.

## Class 13

Today we went over how to store data locally in the users browser. We went over how it's done, the best practices on how to set, get, and remove data. We went over the two different local storage objects, localStorage and sessionStorage, and the differences between them. We went over how to save and retrieve objects in local storage. Because you can only store strings there is a trick to how you would do this. Then we covered a couple of use cases for using localstorage as well as some issues with it.

The lab went well, i actually completed it much faster than i thought i would and with much less code than i expected. I ran into some issues when trying to save the code during the beforeunload event. turns out you are very limited in what you can do in there. I got around this issue by calling another function that saved my objects list in localstorage. What I have now works, but i would like to refactor the code so that when i pull the data from localstorage it will be run through a function that will run that data through my class constructur again so they are proper objects with access to methods. I had to remove my object methods because the loaded objects were not being initialized in the class again.

Overall a great lab. I have wanted to learn how to do this for a long time now! and now i know how!

## Class 14

Today was all about adding movement to the web page using CSS techniques such as transform, transition, and animate. We also learned about Google's journey to create the perfect team.

the transitions and animations all seem like great ways to create a clean and slick interface for your web apps. I'll be testing out different ways to add them to my current projects and try to find out when the best times to use them will be.

I've already found a great use for the transforms. I found it helpful to properly position an element in one of my projects that i was having a hard time getting to be just where i wanted it to be. Now i was able to do this using pixels, but I would like to look into how this would work with relative values such as vw, vh, ect.

I found the article about teams to be very interesting and i'm excited to see how true it is. I know that moving forward I will try to be more open and supportive of my team members so that we can feel like we don't need to watch ourselves around one another. This is something that will take some work on my end because I have a hard time opening up to others, So i'll be working to impliment some of the suggestions in the article so that i can better communicate and be a better team member. I'll make sure that I keep an open mind and adjust my efforts appropriately.

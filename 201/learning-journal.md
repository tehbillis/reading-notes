# Learning Journal

A place to reflect on what I have learned today.

## Day 01

There are a few things that I would like to go over in my journal today. First, the questions presented to me for the first assignment. How do I see myhself planning & evaluating my learning? What details will I record and measure. And finally, I would like to touch on my why. My reason for doing all of this.

### Planning & Evaluating

It's important to me that I succeed in my goals to learn software development, So I have come up with a few things that I will do that I think will help. Let's look at what I can do when it comes to planning my learning:

1. **Set Clear Goals:** I will define what I wish to achieve with my learning. I will set out clear and measurable goals that will give me purpose and direction.
2. **Create a Learning Plan:** I will outline the steps and resources needed to reach my goals. This should include some timelines, milestones, and maybe a list of materials that I'll need. Codefellows completes most of this already, but I can add onto their course plan and I can create my own timelines since I'm doing the self paced course.
3. **Prioritize:** I will find out which topics or skills are most important and relevent to my goals and focus on mastering them before branching out to related areas. Such as mastering HTML, CSS and JS basics before moving on.
4. **Gather Resources:** I will identify the books, online courses, mentors, or anything else I will need to achieve my goals. Most of this has actually been completed, I Will just need to compile them into a document.
5. **Establish a Routine:** I have already decided that I will be setting time aside in the mornings and sometimes in the evenings for my learning. So far the move from evening learning to morning has been slow going, but I will commit to setting myself up for succeeding in this goal and sticking to it.
6. **Stay Organized:** I will keep all my notes organized in my reading notes repo, as well as continue to post my learning experiences in my blog. It may make sense for my blog to essentially become my learning journal for now.

Now let's take a look at what I can do to evaluate my learning:

1. **Codefellows:** Codefellows is already set up to show me what i'm learning and what I need to work a little more on. Tests and quizes will help me understand where I stand.
2. **Feedback:** I will seek feedback from my mentors and my peers.
3. **Regular Self-Assessment:** I will take time through the week to assess my understanding and skill level of the topic that I'm learning and determine if I'm meeting my milestones.
4. **Spaced Repetition:** I will use spaced repetition techniques to review past content and ensure that I am retaining the knowledge that I have learned and solidify it in my mind in the process. It will be a way to see what I need to review and what I have actually learned. Anki cards will probably be my main tool here.
5. **Celebrate:** I will make sure to do something I rarely do, but I will celebrate and acknowledge my achievements and milestones along the way as a way to keep myself motivated.

It's important for me to remember that learning is a journey, it is a continuous activity that I will be doing for the rest of my life. Looking for ways to improve, and taking joy in the process of learning will be very beneficial to me.

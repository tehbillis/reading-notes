# Learning Journal

A place to reflect on what I have learned today.

## Day 01

There are a few things that I would like to go over in my journal today. First, the questions presented to me for the first assignment. How do I see myhself planning & evaluating my learning? What details will I record and measure. And finally, I would like to touch on my why. My reason for doing all of this.

### Planning & Evaluating

It's important to me that I succeed in my goals to learn software development, So I have come up with a few things that I will do that I think will help. Let's look at what I can do when it comes to planning my learning:

1. **Set Clear Goals:** I will define what I wish to achieve with my learning. I will set out clear and measurable goals that will give me purpose and direction.
2. **Create a Learning Plan:** I will outline the steps and resources needed to reach my goals. This should include some timelines, milestones, and maybe a list of materials that I'll need. Codefellows completes most of this already, but I can add onto their course plan and I can create my own timelines since I'm doing the self paced course.
3. **Prioritize:** I will find out which topics or skills are most important and relevent to my goals and focus on mastering them before branching out to related areas. Such as mastering HTML, CSS and JS basics before moving on.
4. **Gather Resources:** I will identify the books, online courses, mentors, or anything else I will need to achieve my goals. Most of this has actually been completed, I Will just need to compile them into a document.
5. **Establish a Routine:** I have already decided that I will be setting time aside in the mornings and sometimes in the evenings for my learning. So far the move from evening learning to morning has been slow going, but I will commit to setting myself up for succeeding in this goal and sticking to it.
6. **Stay Organized:** I will keep all my notes organized in my reading notes repo, as well as continue to post my learning experiences in my blog. It may make sense for my blog to essentially become my learning journal for now.

Now let's take a look at what I can do to evaluate my learning:

1. **Codefellows:** Codefellows is already set up to show me what i'm learning and what I need to work a little more on. Tests and quizes will help me understand where I stand.
2. **Feedback:** I will seek feedback from my mentors and my peers.
3. **Regular Self-Assessment:** I will take time through the week to assess my understanding and skill level of the topic that I'm learning and determine if I'm meeting my milestones.
4. **Spaced Repetition:** I will use spaced repetition techniques to review past content and ensure that I am retaining the knowledge that I have learned and solidify it in my mind in the process. It will be a way to see what I need to review and what I have actually learned. Anki cards will probably be my main tool here.
5. **Celebrate:** I will make sure to do something I rarely do, but I will celebrate and acknowledge my achievements and milestones along the way as a way to keep myself motivated.

It's important for me to remember that learning is a journey, it is a continuous activity that I will be doing for the rest of my life. Looking for ways to improve, and taking joy in the process of learning will be very beneficial to me.

## Day 02

Today I will go ahead a write a breif reflection on what I learned this day. Overall the content was really good. I can't say that any of the information was really new, but I took the opportunity to solidify most of the knowledge that I already knew. Specifically the JS learnings. The logic is something I feel like I have a solid understanding of, and it was nice to knock the cobwebs out of my mind and see just how much I remember and understand.

When it came to the CSS though, I have certainly worked with the box model before and have struggled with it over the years. In fact, I would describe the way I initially learned it was by struggling with it. But it was very nice to get a more in depth understanding of just what is going on here and the ways that it can be used and manipulated.

Lists are somethings I'm familiar with, though I have never once changed the attributes on a list to have it display different symbols and numbers or reverse the list. That was really cool to learn!

## Day 03

Today We learned about hyperlinks, layouts, and functions. We also touched on the concept of paired programming. Turns out hyperlinks are a way to not only navigate to different pages on the web, but they're also handy in navigating the page itself. Layouts are pretty important when it comes to making a page look the way you wish. Understanding how normal flow works and how you can use positioning to modify that flow, and create unique styles. There are a number of positioning styles that you can use to achieve these uinique effects. Functions are a standard way to organize code that you want to do a singel thing, but access it more than once.

Pair programming is a concept that i'm familiar with but is something that i've never actually done. I understand the concepts of each role, I even did a little bit of a dive on how to be a good driver and how to be a good navigator. Seems teamwork, collaboration, constructive communication and keeping an open mind is key here. It can probably be tough to work with someone who you feel is constantly shooting down your ideas and calling them stupid. It seems important to let the driver make the decisions, and to only offer suggestions and then step back to let them choose what to do. when driving it seems important to be clear what your thought process is, what you're doing, and why. of course there is a lot more to it than just this, but these are what seem to be some of the most important things that stood out to me.

## Day 04

Today was all about colors, images, and text. Honestly these are some of the topics I fear the most simply because I feel i'm not that proficient with them. Going over images was not so bad, i've worked with them before and I learned a lot about the accessibility aspect that goes along with them. That is something new to me that I'm glad  I learned. Going over all the image types was great because there were quite a few that I was not familiar with but i'm glad I know about now!

Fonts and colors were the topics that my brain kind of lost focus on. These are things I find difficult to grasp, so my brain wants to do anything but these things. I'm glad I made it through the material because I feel like I came out of it with a better understanding and more confidence in myself. My about me project reflects that, The entire project used zero colors until these classes. It really is just a lot and i'm afraid that I will miss something, but I know it's not something I should let hold me back.

Working more with git branching was so great. Branching finally makes sense to me, and I'm confident enough to work with it no questions asked now.

# The Coders Computer

Today we learned about text editors and what they can be used for in an every day sense, as well as what software devs would use them for. Text editors are software that do
what their name implies, they edit text. But not all text editors are equal. A basic editor has nothing special about it, you can write a text document or a piece of software
in it, but it doesn't really have the features that help you write code. You can pick up an editor that was created with special features for software creation, these features
to look for would be things like code completion, syntax highlighting, themes and extensions. Code completion and syntax highlighting can help you code by making the code easier
to read, and to see your options as you write your code. Themes can help prevent eye strain or just make you feel cool while you work. Extensions are tools to help cover your
project needs or give you extra useful features. Now a text editor can help you create full blown websites, but they are still not as powerful as an Integrated Developer Environment (IDE).

> **NOTE:** Emmet is a cool shorthand that can be used to quickly create HTML, CSS, and other types of code files. It may be built into the text editor or be installed via an extension.

We also looked into the shell or bash console. It is an extremely simple and powerful way to navigate and modify files on your system. It is available on all operating systems.
You can even write code in your terminal and never leave if you were so inclined with tools like VIM. It is one of the main ways software developers setup their coding
Environment. It is very handy and I personally love using the terminal whenever I get a chance.

## Answer

1. **What are four important features to look for in a text editor? -** Code completion, syntax highlighting, themes, and extensions.
2. What do the following commands do?
   1. `pwd` **-** Prints the current working directory that you are in.
   2. `ls` **-** List the contents of your current working directory.
   3. `cd` **-** Change directory.
   4. `mkdir` **-** Make a directory.
   5. `touch` **-** Creates a blank file.
3. Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)
   1. `cd projects` **-** Navigate to your directory called "projects".
   2. `mkdir new-project` **-** Create a new folder named "new-project".
   3. `touch new-project/newfile.md` **-** Create a new blank file in your new-project folder named "newfile.md".
   4. `cd ..` **-** Navigate back to your original location that you started at.
   5. `ls projects/new-project` **-** List the contents of the new folder that you created, this will return "newfile.md".

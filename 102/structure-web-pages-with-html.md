# Structure Web Pages With HTML

## Wireframes

Wireframes are a way to layout your website or webpage in very simple, black and white terms so you can see how the user will interact with your site. Some people like using wire framing applications on their computer, and others may feel more comfortable using a pen and paper.

Some things to note:

1. Wireframes made in pencil and paper or whiteboard, can be easily and cheaply changed.
2. You can easily replicate and test with users when using paper prototypes.
3. Switching later to software allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions.

Something to know is that the process used to go from wireframe to code can be a very short or very long process depending on the requirements and needs of the project. Often times the process can take a while if there isnâ€™t much known about what is needed, so lots of testing and experimenting may be required. Some examples of this process can look like:

* Wireframe > interactive prototype > visual > design
* Sketch > code
* Sketch > wireframe > Hi-Def wireframe > visual > code
* Sketch > wireframe > visual > code

3 key principles of good wireframes.

1. Clarity
   * Your wireframe is a representation of what your site is trying to accomplish and what your users need. There shouldn't be any clutter or distractions.
2. Confidence
   * Navigation and basic elements of your site should be familiar and inspire confidence in the user. Buttons, forms, and navigation should be layed out in a familiar way so people aren't trying to guess how to use your software.
3. Simplicity is Key
   * Remove distractions so users can achieve their goals. The wireframe is a visual guide to the framework of your site and that is all. Beautification should come later.

## Semantic Element in HTML

Semantic html is a way to use your code to represent that data contained within it. It makes it easier to see what the different parts of the web page are. There are many other benefits as well such as influencing search engines, accessibility for the disabled, finding meaningful code instead of searching through endless div tags, suggesting what type of data should be there, and semantic naming mirrors proper sumo element/component naming standards.

Here are some of the roughly 100 semantic elements available

* `<article>`
* `<aside>`
* `<details>`
* `<figcaption>`
* `<figure>`
* `<footer>`
* `<form>`
* `<header>`
* `<main>`
* `<mark>`
* `<nav>`
* `<section>`
* `<summary>`
* `<time>`

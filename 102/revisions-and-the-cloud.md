# Revisions and the Cloud

Git is a Distributed Version Control System that helps you store data in a way that you can track the changes, see who made the changes, and revert back to a previous state
of a file. It is one of the top version control systems used today. It was created in 2005 by the infamous Linus Torvalds in response to issues that he had with the service
he was using at the time. There was a lot of technical information in this reading that it seems difficult to go into without, well, getting too technical.

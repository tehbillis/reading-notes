# Learning Markdown

Markdown is a simple to use markup language that is used to format elements on all kinds of written media that include websites, research papers, notes, emails and even books.
Once learned, it can be an incredibly powerful yet simple way to make your content look great as well as organized. It was designed to be easy to read even if it's not fully
rendered, and can be read or made on all major operating systems. Its simplicity also helps it to be futureproof so that even if the program rendering this page stops working
for some reason, it can easily be moved to anoter and be accessed just the same.

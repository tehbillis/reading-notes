Here you will find some of my personal takes on the classes and assignments so far.

## Revisions and the Cloud - Practice with git

So far the git course has been my favorite. This is a technology that I've known about and have played with just enough to get by, but never took the time to actually learn. It has been exciting to practice the basics, so now it doesn't seem like an alien language that I don't understand. I even took the time to lookup some extra material on [how to best write commit messages](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/) so that my git logs are clear and easy to understand.

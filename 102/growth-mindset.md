# Growth Mindset

A growth mindset is the idea that you are an ever changing creature capable of things that you currently are not able to do. It is the idea that challenges and obstacles are not things that merely slow you down or keep you from your goal, but rather, they are part of the path to where you are headed. It is what helps us see our mistakes not as failures, but rather as lessons to be learned from. A growth mindset can help us turn people that we may see as rivals into people that we can learn from. A growth mindset is an ever learning, improving, and growing way of life.

## Ways to stay in a Growth Mindset

1. Review the day and note the best thing that happened, and something that I can do better the next day and come up with a plan keeping in mind that growth is a process and not a destination.
2. Ask questions and have real conversations with my peers and people who are more knowledgeable than I am and really listen to the feedback recieved from them.
3. Take care to celebrate the successes that are achieved.

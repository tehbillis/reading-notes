## [What Google learned from its quest to the perfect team](https://www.google.com/amp/mobile.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.amp.html)

### Perfect Team Qestions

1. **To what extent did psychological safety impact your previous work experience? -** There was a team that I had joined that I thought was going to be a great group of people to work with, partly because one of my older brothers was part of that team. Despite that fact, it became pretty clear that I didn't feel like I could truly be part of that team because I didn't feel like I could be myself and Felt like I couldn't afford to make any mistakes or ask for help. So I chose to find work elsewhere.
2. **How does this article inform your approach to working with others moving forward? -** This makes it clear to me that it's important to accept people for who they are and find ways to make sure that they feel like they are part of the team and that they can rely on everyone else, as well as making sure they understand that they are competent and can be relied on by the team. Allowing people to be themselves and do what they do best Is something I think is important to group cohession.

# Retrospection

## 01

**What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?**

Creating the new components went well. It's certainly different from vanilla JS but not so much that I struggled.

**What did I learn today?**

That using props isn't always simple and straightforward. I had a fun time learning how to use props to display an image.

**What should I do differently next time?**

Maybe watch the assigned video before attempting the assignment.

**What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?**

Arrow functions, I know we will be using them a lot more, and we only touched on them near the end of the last course. So I certainly need to keep practicing them. I faught the syntax for a little bit today, but eventually worked it out.

**Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?**

The assignment is complete.

## 02

**What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?**

Working with the map function went very well!

**What did I learn today?**

That you need to include the react-bootstrap css to your project or your components won't display properly. learning that the map function doesn't modify the original array and returns a new array was very easy to understand.

**What should I do differently next time?**

Pay closer attention to the lecture, I'm sure the teacher told us to import the bootstrap styles, but I must have missed it.

**What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?**

react-bootstrap layouts, man those things really worked my brain.

## 03

**What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?** 

Working with the filter function went very well. it's very similar to the map function in a way.

**What did I learn today?** 

How to use the filter function on an array. How to create a modal that is created on demand and is not prepopulated on the page.

**What should I do differently next time?** 

Put headphones in, hood up, and focus on just the task at hand.

**What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?** 

there was a coding challenge that implimented both filter and map, and oh man, that was a tricky one to solve and i'm not entirely sure that I fully understand my solution.

## 04

**What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?**

destructuring wasn't as bad as I had initally thought. Implimenting forms was also a success with fairly minimal research!

**What did I learn today?**

Learned how to impliment forms in a github project. Also learned how to utilize the spread and destructuring methods.

**What should I do differently next time?**

Find a way to get into a flow state quicker.

**What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?**

Nothing at this time

The assignment is complete.

## 05

**What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?**

Traversing objects with Object.keys and Object.values went really well. I had one problem that I gave a really not so great solution to, mostly because i'm tired, but I went back and refactored it so that it was done correctly. I think it was the right thing to do for myself and my learning journey.

**What did I learn today?**

How to traverse objects! also how to navigate somebody elses code!

**What should I do differently next time?**

work to stay focused on the task at hand. Distractions seem to pull me away fairly easily.

**What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?**

Nothing really, I feel like I had an AHA moment with the coding challenges today. The concepts really weren't clicking untill I dove in and started working out solutions to the challenges.

**Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?**

The assignment is complete.

# Retrospection

## 01

### What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?

Creating the new components went well. It's certainly different from vanilla JS but not so much that I struggled.

### What did I learn today?

That using props isn't always simple and straightforward. I had a fun time learning how to use props to display an image.

### What should I do differently next time?

Maybe watch the assigned video before attempting the assignment.

### What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

Arrow functions, I know we will be using them a lot more, and we only touched on them near the end of the last course. So I certainly need to keep practicing them. I faught the syntax for a little bit today, but eventually worked it out.

### Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

The assignment is complete.

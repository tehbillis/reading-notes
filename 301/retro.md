# Retrospection

## 01

**What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?**

Creating the new components went well. It's certainly different from vanilla JS but not so much that I struggled.

**What did I learn today?**

That using props isn't always simple and straightforward. I had a fun time learning how to use props to display an image.

**What should I do differently next time?**

Maybe watch the assigned video before attempting the assignment.

**What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?**

Arrow functions, I know we will be using them a lot more, and we only touched on them near the end of the last course. So I certainly need to keep practicing them. I faught the syntax for a little bit today, but eventually worked it out.

**Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?**

The assignment is complete.

## 02

**What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?**

Working with the map function went very well!

**What did I learn today?**

That you need to include the react-bootstrap css to your project or your components won't display properly. learning that the map function doesn't modify the original array and returns a new array was very easy to understand.

**What should I do differently next time?**

Pay closer attention to the lecture, I'm sure the teacher told us to import the bootstrap styles, but I must have missed it.

**What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?**

react-bootstrap layouts, man those things really worked my brain.

**Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?**

The assignment is complete.

# Introduction to React and components

## Component-based architecture

The primary objective of CBA is to ensure component reusability. A component encapsulates functionality and behaviors of a software element into a reusable and self-deployable binary unit.

## Component-based architecture Questions

1. **What is a “component”? -** A modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well defined functionality that encapsulates its implimentation and exporting it as a high level interface.

2. **What are the characteristics of a component? -** Reusability, replaceable, not context specific, extensible, encapsulated, and independant.

3. **What are the advantages of using component-based architecture? -** Reduced dev time by reusing components and increased reliability by only needing to fix issues in one place rather than every place it is implimented.

## What is props and how to use it in React

Props data is read only, it can't be changed by children components.

Props are objects, use dot notation to access different properties

## Props Questions

1. **What is “props” short for? -** Properties
2. **How are props used in React? -** They pass data from one component to another.
3. **What is the flow of props? -** They are passed in a single direction from parent to child.

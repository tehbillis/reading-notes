My name is Will Green, and I live in the Seattle area. I actually have a background in software development, but it has been a very long time since i've really worked professionally and the industry has changed since then. I started learning coding in high school where i spent half my day at a tech center that simulated working in a corporate environment. after two years of that I got my start working for a company that is now owned by grubhub. After that i worked in two different backend dev positions before life events made me decide to step away. It's been well over a decade and although I have done a few projects here and there over those years I don't feel like i'm proficient any longer and so i'm excited and ready to be here to master these skills with all of you.

This is a repository of my notes as I work my way through the Code Fellows coding bootcamp.

Please feel free to follow my progress on github as well as my blog.

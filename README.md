My name is Will Green (he/him), and I live in the Seattle area. I actually have a background in software development, but it has been a very long time since i've really worked professionally and the industry has changed since then. I started learning coding in high school where i spent half my day at a tech center that simulated working in a corporate environment. after two years of that I got my start working for a company that is now owned by grubhub. After that i worked in two different backend dev positions before life events made me decide to step away. It's been well over a decade and although I have done a few projects here and there over those years I don't feel like i'm proficient any longer and so i'm excited and ready to be here to master these skills with all of you.

Please feel free to follow my progress on github as well as my blog.

## Growth Mindset

A growth mindset is the idea that you are an ever changing creature capable of things that you currently are not able to do. It is the idea that challenges and obstacles are not things that merely slow you down or keep you from your goal, but rather, they are part of the path to where you are headed. It is what helps us see our mistakes not as failures, but rather as lessons to be learned from. A growth mindset can help us turn people that we may see as rivals into people that we can learn from. A growth mindset is an ever learning, improving, and growing way of life.

### Ways to stay in a Growth Mindset
1. Review the day and note the best thing that happened, and something that I can do better the next day and come up with a plan keeping in mind that growth is a process and not a destination.
2. Ask questions and have real conversations with my peers and people who are more knowledgeable than I am and really listen to the feedback recieved from them.
3. Take care to celebrate the successes that are achieved.

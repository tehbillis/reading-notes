My name is Will Green, and I live in the Seattle area. I actually have a background in software development, but it has been a very long time since i've really worked professionally and the industry has changed since then. I started learning coding in high school where i spent half my day at a tech center that simulated working in a corporate environment. after two years of that I got my start working for a company that is now owned by grubhub. After that i worked in two different backend dev positions before life events made me decide to step away. It's been well over a decade and although I have done a few projects here and there over those years I don't feel like i'm proficient any longer and so i'm excited and ready to be here to master these skills with all of you.

Please feel free to follow my progress on github as well as my blog.
